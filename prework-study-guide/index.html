        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline styling is style defined in the element tag and has to be changed individually.</li>
          <li>Internal stylesheets are located in the header element of an html file and styles all elements of that type in the file.</li>
          <li>External stylesheets are .css files connected to an html file where elements can be styled from.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git is useful for collabrating on a project with others without overwriting each others work.</li>
          <li>Properly managing git workflow will leave a clear history of changes made and make tracking bugs easier.</li>
          <li>Making sure to update the main branch to your local directory before making changes ensures it's up to date before making any changes.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a JS file is read from top to bottom. With conditional statements you can change what is code is executed.</li>
          <li>If statements are conditional statements that evaluate the passed parameter and only execute if the check is met.</li>
          <li>Else-if statements are conditional statements that rely on boolean values to be evaluated, and only execute the code if it is truthy, going to the next conditional if it's falsy.</li>
          <li>Arrays are a way to store multiple values in a single variable. They can have different data types.</li>
          <li>Array index values start at 0.</li>
          <li>For loops are a way to repeat code as long as a condition is met.</li>
          <li>Using arrays and for loops is a convenient way to work with large amount of data without having to address each item individually.</li>
