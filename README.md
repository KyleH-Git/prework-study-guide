# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was the first step of the coding bootcamp I'm currently going through. It was made to have easy access to notes about the basics of web development, and a convenient way to access notes about the languages introduced to me at this stage: HTML, CSS, and JS. The project was a learning experience in the basics of these languages as well as how to properly use Git as a version control system. By working on this project I was able to dip my toes into understanding what goes on in web development as well as the process of using GitHub.
